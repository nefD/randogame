This is a browser based adventure roguelike game I'm working on here and there. It's got some pretty neat features but only a bare minimum of content. Here's what's in:

* Procedural world egeneration for each new game
* Biomes with their own unique item and creature spawn tables
* Basic needs; you need to eat and you need to sleep
* Day and night cycle, including tracking the world date and time
* Turn based jrpg style combat
* Skills and abilities
* Grid/room based world navigation
* Resource harvesting and crafting

When I get around to it, I'll post up the todo list.
